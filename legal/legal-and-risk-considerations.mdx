Funtend operates at the intersection of digital assets, physical goods, and decentralized infrastructure. With this innovation comes a set of unique legal and regulatory challenges that we proactively address to protect users, partners, and the long-term sustainability of the platform.

### **Legal Structure**
- **Entity Formation**: Funtend is operated under a compliant legal entity, with jurisdiction selected based on Web3-forward regulations and IP protections.
- **Token Issuance Compliance**: The FNTD token is structured as a utility and governance token with no expectation of profit or investment return, aligning with global crypto guidelines.
- **Consumer Protection**: We incorporate transparent TOS, refund mechanisms for failed drops, and KYC/AML compliance for fiat-to-crypto gateways (when applicable).

### **Risk Management**
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: We closely monitor evolving legal frameworks around NFTs, DePIN, and tokenized commerce in key jurisdictions (e.g., U.S., EU, SEA).
- **Smart Contract Audits**: All critical contracts (NFT minting, token operations, marketplace logic) undergo third-party security audits before mainnet deployment.
- **Physical Fulfillment Risks**: We work with vetted, professional logistics and production partners to minimize delays, defects, or disputes in physical delivery.
- **IP & Content Risks**: Creator-submitted content is reviewed via automated and human moderation to avoid copyright violations or offensive material.

Funtend aims to set the standard in compliant Web3 fashion experiences, ensuring both innovation and trust.

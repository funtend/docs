The Funtend experience is built for both fashion creators and consumers. Each journey is designed to be intuitive, rewarding, and powered by Web3 tools that remain invisible until they’re needed. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the typical user flow for both roles.

## Creator Journey

1. **Onboarding** \
  Creators sign up and customize their profile. Optional KYC is available for premium drop access.

2. **Design with AI Tools** \
  Funtend offers generative design interfaces powered by fine-tuned diffusion models and LLMs for sketching, patterns, and branding.

3. **Drop Configuration** \
  Creators set:
    - Quantity (limited drops)
    - Product types (hoodies, tees, jackets, etc.)
    - NFC/physical production (Funtend-managed or self-handled)
    - Royalty % and revenue splits
    - Metadata and collector incentives

4. **Mint as NFT + NFC Pairing** \
  Every product is tokenized on Polygon and assigned an NFC chip (optional in early releases). The metadata includes provenance, creator, and authenticity info.

5. **Launch & Earn** \
  Drop goes live. Creators earn upfront from sales and ongoing royalties from resales. Popular drops are promoted on the curated feed.

## Collector Journey

1. **Browse & Discover** \
  Collectors explore drops by category, style, creator, or rarity. They can follow creators and get alerts for new releases.

2. **Purchase & Verify** \
  Buyers can purchase fashion NFTs which link to the physical counterpart. NFC scanning enables proof of authenticity and ownership.

3. **Engage & Earn** \
  Collectors earn **$FNTD** by:
    - Liking new drops (Like-to-Earn)
    - Reselling on the marketplace (Trade-to-Earn)
    - Participating in missions or community contests

4. **Showcase & Trade** \
  Owners can showcase their collection, wear the physical item, or list their NFT on secondary markets—combining streetwear culture with digital liquidity.

Funtend's user journey focuses on ease, excitement, and empowerment—making Web3 fashion accessible to all, without needing to understand blockchain or NFTs.

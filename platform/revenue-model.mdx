Funtend generates revenue through a diversified, scalable model designed to grow alongside its user base while maintaining alignment with creators and communities.

1. **Primary Drop Sales** \
  Funtend earns a fixed percentage (e.g., 10–15%) from every primary NFT fashion drop sold on the platform. The rest goes directly to the creator, with configurable royalty splits for collaborators or co-brands.

2. **Secondary Market Royalties** \
  Every resale on the Funtend marketplace incurs a royalty fee. This fee is split between:
    - Original creator (e.g., 4–6%)
    - Funtend platform (e.g., 1–3%)

  This ensures creators benefit from long-term value while the platform grows sustainably.

3. **Physical Product Fulfillment** \
  For creators using Funtend’s integrated fulfillment:
    - Funtend earns a margin per unit sold (built into pricing)
    - Optional premium add-ons (e.g., sustainable fabrics, advanced NFC) increase margins

4. **AI Tool Access (Freemium Model)** \
  While basic AI design tools are free, Funtend offers:
    - Premium AI models
    - Advanced customization
    - Team access
      These are offered via monthly subscriptions or **$FNTD** token staking.

5. **Featured Listings & Promotions** \
  Brands, creators, and collectors can pay in **$FNTD** or stablecoins to boost visibility via:
    - Homepage features
    - Sponsored sections
    - Limited-time trend highlights

6. **Token Utility Integration** \
  Users pay certain platform fees (e.g., minting, NFC activation, early access to drops) in FNTD tokens, which are partially burned or redistributed to stakers.

Funtend’s revenue model ensures long-term sustainability, supports creator success, and gives tokenholders real utility and value—without over-relying on speculation or one-time drops.

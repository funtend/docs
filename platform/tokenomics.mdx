The $FNTD token is the backbone of Funtend’s economy, designed to incentivize participation, reward meaningful contributions, and govern the future of the platform.

### **Token Utility**

$FNTD is used across the platform to:
- **Mint NFTs & Activate NFCs**: Required to tokenize new fashion items and register them onchain.
- **Access Premium Features**: Unlock exclusive AI design tools, analytics, and drop early access.
- **Pay Platform Fees**: Used for marketplace commissions, boosted listings, and fulfillment margins.
- **Staking & Creator Support**: Stake $FNTD to back creators, gain perks, or unlock voting rights.

### **Incentives & Rewards**

$FNTD is distributed to reward:
- **Creators**: For minting successful collections and high engagement.
- **Collectors**: Through Like-to-Earn, Trade-to-Earn, and event-based campaigns.
- **Community Contributors**: For moderation, design contests, referrals, or verified reports of counterfeit content.
- **Stakers**: Earn a share of platform revenue and token emissions by staking FNTD in protocol pools.

### **Supply and Allocation (Example Breakdown)**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 FNTD
- **Ecosystem Incentives**: 40%
- **Team & Advisors**: 20% (vesting over 3–4 years)
- **Public Sale / Community Round**: 15%
- **Strategic Partnerships**: 10%
- **Liquidity Provision**: 10%
- **Reserve / Treasury**: 5%

This breakdown is subject to refinement before launch and will be governed via community input.

### **Deflationary Mechanics**
- **Token Burns**: A portion of FNTD used in minting, premium access, or creator support is burned.
- **Staking Locks**: Time-based lockups for governance power reduce circulating supply.

The $FNTD token is not just a payment method—it’s a core engine for creator-led value generation and shared governance across the Funtend ecosystem.

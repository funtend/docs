Funtend’s governance model empowers token holders and key stakeholders to shape the platform’s evolution transparently and democratically.

### **Governance Structure**
- **Token-Based Voting**: Holders of $FNTD tokens have voting rights proportional to their stake. Voting decisions cover platform upgrades, feature prioritization, fund allocations, and community proposals.
- **Proposal System**: Any community member with a minimum $FNTD stake can submit governance proposals. Proposals are discussed openly and put to a vote after community feedback.
- **Delegated Voting**: Token holders can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives, enabling efficient participation even for smaller holders.
- **Multi-Signature Treasury**: The Funtend treasury is controlled by a multi-sig wallet with signatories from the core team and trusted community members to ensure secure and transparent fund management.

### **Key Governance Topics**
- **Product Roadmap Adjustments**: Deciding on new features, integrations, or changes to existing functionality.
- **Tokenomics Updates**: Modifications to emission schedules, rewards, and staking parameters.
- **Ecosystem Grants & Partnerships**: Approving fund disbursements for ecosystem growth and collaborations.
- **Community Rules & Moderation**: Setting standards for content, conduct, and platform use policies.
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: Supporting projects or changes to reduce environmental impact and promote circular fashion.

### **Governance Goals**
- **Transparency**: Every vote and decision is recorded onchain, ensuring public accountability.
- **Inclusivity**: Encouraging broad participation from creators, collectors, and community members.
- **Responsiveness**: Enabling timely updates that reflect the evolving needs of the ecosystem.
- **Security**: Protecting the platform and its assets from centralized or malicious control.

By decentralizing governance, Funtend aligns incentives, fosters trust, and ensures that the platform grows according to the collective vision of its vibrant community.
